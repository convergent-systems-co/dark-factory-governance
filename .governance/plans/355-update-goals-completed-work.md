## 1. Objective

Update GOALS.md to reflect recently completed work and remove stale entries for closed issues.

## 2. Rationale

GOALS.md had stale data: issues #41 and #42 were listed as "Needs Refinement" but are closed, and 8 recently merged PRs were not tracked.

| Alternative | Considered | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Leave as-is | Yes | Stale data creates confusion about project state |
| Full rewrite | Yes | Overkill — only the recent section and open work needed updates |
| Targeted update (chosen) | Yes | Minimal change, addresses all stale entries |

## 3. Scope

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| N/A | N/A |

### Files to Modify

| File | Change Description |
|------|-------------------|
| `GOALS.md` | Add "Documentation Site & Tooling" section with 8 recent PRs; remove stale "Needs Refinement" section |

### Files to Delete

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| N/A | N/A |

## 4. Approach

1. Remove "Needs Refinement" section (issues #41, #42 are closed)
2. Add "Documentation Site & Tooling" section with PRs #341-#354
3. Commit with conventional commit format

## 5. Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Coverage | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Manual verification | GOALS.md | Verify all entries have correct issue/PR numbers |

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Incorrect PR/issue mapping | Low | Low | Verified via gh CLI |

## 7. Dependencies

- [x] No blocking dependencies

## 8. Backward Compatibility

N/A — documentation-only change.

## 9. Governance

| Panel | Required | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| documentation-review | Yes | Primary change is documentation |
| security-review | Yes | Always required |

**Policy Profile:** default
**Expected Risk Level:** negligible

## 10. Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-25 | Grouped PRs #343/#344 under issue #336 | Both PRs originated from the same feature issue |
